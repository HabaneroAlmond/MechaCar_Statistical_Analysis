# Analyzing production data of AutosRUs 'MechaCar'
AutoRUs' new prototype 'MechaCar' is suffering from production issues and the management tasked our data analytics team with reviewing their production data. To help AutoRUs' our team:
  -performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify which parts of our production data can help predict the MPG of the prototype.
  -collected summary statistics on the PSI of the suspension coils
  -used t tests to find out if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  -designed a statistical study to compare the MechaCar to vehicles from other car companies
